# One day with the MuLearn Community
Welcome to the μLearn community! As a new member, you may be wondering what exactly this community is all about and what kind of activities you can expect to participate in. In this blog post, we'll explore some of the tasks that you may encounter as a new member of the μLearn community, and I'll share my personal experience with these tasks.

Task 1: Self Introduction to the community

The first task that you'll likely encounter when joining the μLearn community is introducing yourself to other members. This is a great opportunity to let others know who you are, what your interests are, and what you hope to gain from being a part of this community. When I introduced myself, I shared a little bit about my background in software development and my interest in learning new technologies.

Task 2: Introduction to Discord

Discord is the platform that the μLearn community uses to communicate and collaborate. As a new member, you'll need to join the community's Discord server and familiarize yourself with its features. This may include creating a profile, joining different channels, and learning how to send messages and interact with other members. When I first joined Discord, I found it to be a very welcoming and active community, with members always willing to help out and answer questions.
